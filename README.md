The project has been prepared in the uploaded [EXCEL file](https://github.com/PatrycjaDanilczuk/Financial-Analysis-Investment-comparison/blob/main/1.%20Financial%20Analyst_project_pdanil_20.05.2024.xlsx)

# Project overview
## 1. Defining business problem
Compare two development scenarios for a startup company that produces gadgets for smart homes. 
The first investment opportunity is to build an extension of a factory building and increase manufacturing activities (Scenario 1). The second scenario suggests building a digital product and investing in marketing (Scenario 2). 
Evaluate which scenario (if any) the company should go for.

## 2.	Preparing required data and additional assumptions
Financial statement (Income statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) of the company for 2016 and 2017 was reviewed for further data and assumptions necessary for the analysis.
Required additional assumptions (Expected Rate of Return, projected inflation, duration for evaluation and other) have been taken and backgrounded according to macroeconomic data (the sources have been provided in the project’s documentation – Excel file “Project tab”).

## 3. Analyzing data
Preparing comprehensive analysis and financial metrics to evaluate and compare the two development scenarios, from both the company as well as the stakeholders' point of view:

•	Cash Flow Projection

•	Net Present Value (NPV)

•	Internal Risk of Return (IRR)

•	Return on Investment (ROI)

•	Return on Equity (ROE)

•	Payback period

•	Break-even analysis

•	Opportunity costs

•	Profitability Index (PI)

•	Risk analysis

The results have been provided in the project’s documentation – Excel file “Project tab”.

## 4. Communicating analysis results and providing actionable insights
The conclusions from the analysis and recommended solution have been provided in in the project’s documentation – Excel file “Project tab”.

Additionally, as a part of the project, a presentation for the business (the Company’s COO) has been prepared to communicate analysis results and recommendation.
